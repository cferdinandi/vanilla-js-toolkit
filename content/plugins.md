These are hand-selected plugins that I would actually use or have used on a project.

As a result, the list is a lot shorter than some of the bigger "plugin repositories" you'll find on the web. Ideally, the quality is better.

*__Note:__ Plugins with a ⭐️ next to them are ones that I wrote or manage.*
